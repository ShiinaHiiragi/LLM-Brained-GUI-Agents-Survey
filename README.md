## üôå Contributing

ü§ù**Contributions Welcome!**

We encourage the community to contribute to this repository. If you have suggestions for new papers, resources, or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

To contribute, follow these steps:

### 1. Find the paper category

Find the `*.json` file in the [`data`](https://github.com/vyokky/LLM-Brained-GUI-Agents-Survey/tree/main/data) directory which matches the category of the paper you want to add. It should be either `survey`, `framework`, `dataset`, `model`, `benchmark`, `gui-testing`, or `visual-assistant`.

- `survey`: Papers that provide a survey of the LLM-Powered GUI Agents.
- `framework`: Papers that introduce a new framework or architecture for LLM-Powered GUI Agents.
- `dataset`: Papers that introduce a new dataset for optimizing models for LLM-Powered GUI Agents.
- `model`: Papers that introduce a new optimized model for LLM-Powered GUI Agents.
- `benchmark`: Papers that introduce a new benchmark for evaluating LLM-Powered GUI Agents.
- `gui-testing`: Papers that uses LLM-powered agents for GUI testing. It is mainly focused on the testing applications aspect.
- `visual-assistant`: Papers, open-source projects, or products that use LLM-powered agents for visual assistance, such as voice assistants, produtized web agents, etc. It is mainly focused on the applications aspect.
### 2. Add the paper details

In the corresponding json file, add the paper details in the following format to the existing list of papers:

```json
{
    "Name": "Paper Title",
    "Platform": "Device or OS Platform, e.g. Mobile, Web, Desktop, Android, Windows, etc.",
    "Date": "Month Year",
    "Paper_Url": "The paper link of the paper",
    "Highlight": "A brief highlight of the paper, up to 2 sentences.",
    "Code_Url": "The project or code link of the paper",
}
```
### 3. Submit a Pull Request

After adding the paper details, submit a pull request with the title `Add Paper: Paper Title` and we will review it as soon as possible. Once the pull request is merged, the paper will be automatically added to the **[Searchable Paper Page](https://vyokky.github.io/LLM-Brained-GUI-Agents-Survey/)**.
